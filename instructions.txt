Here's a quick instructions file for running most of the code here.



1. download the file in the correct format with the correct labels from fludb.org

2. translate the fasta file with translateData, adjust the file so it suits your needs

3. the translated file can be read with readData. Different functions in readData help with different input formats like PHOC of plain fasta

4. to run knn or kmedoids, look at testknn and testkmedoids respectively.
